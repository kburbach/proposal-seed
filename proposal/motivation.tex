Many such systems already exist, but most seem to be geared toward generic topic domains. One specific area that has been targetted for automatic scoring is English as a Second Language (ESL). Grading ESL essays poses challenge to automated scoring. It is possible that a majority of the sentences are malformed with incorrect spellings \cite{ESOL2}.

\cite{ESOL} proposed a new method and dataset for grading these ESOL texts. The Cambridge Learner Corpus is large collection of text produced by English language learners and was used as training data \cite{ESOL}. 

Over a corpus of more than 300 essays, the system in \cite{ESOL2} agreed with human raters about 66\% of the time.\ Even with a specific corpus, automated grading of ESL essays remains a challenge. 

ESL as as subject area poses difficulites that make it unsuitable to use a generic grading systems, and I believe history another subject area that would benefit from having a tailored grading system. In this project, I propose such a history specific automated grading system.
