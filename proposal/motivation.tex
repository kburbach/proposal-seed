Many such systems already exist, but most seem to be geared toward generic topic domains. One specific area that has been targetted for automatic scoring is English as a Second Language (ESL). Grading ESL essays poses a significant challenge to automated scoring. The majority of the sentences could be malformed and could possibly contain numerous spelling mistakes \cite{ESOL2}.

Yannakoudakis, Briscoe, and Medlock proposed a new method and dataset for grading these ESL texts. The new training dataset came from the Cambridge Learner Corpus - a large collection of text produced by english language learners \cite{ESOL}. 

Even with a specific corpus, automated grading of ESL essays remains a challenge; over a corpus of more than 300 essays, the system discussed in Lonsdale and Diane, \cite{ESOL2}, agreed with human raters about 66\% of the time.\  

ESL as a subject area poses difficulites that make it unsuitable for use with generic grading systems, and this paper proposes history is another subject area that would benefit from having a tailored grading system. This paper proposes such a history specific automated grading system.
